					<h3>Who was James Clerk Maxwell?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>James was <b>born</b> in Edinburgh on June 13th, <b>1831</b> and brought up in <b>Kirkcudbrightshire</b></li>
						<li>He was inquisitive and often asked <b>"What's the go' o' that?"</b> ("How does that work?")</li>
						<li>He loved <b>geometry</b> (the maths of shapes) and published his first scientific paper on <b>oval curves</b> at the age of <b>14</b></li>
						<li>Most of his work was done on <b>electricity, light</b> and <b>electromagnetism</b> (a force that explains how magnetic and electric fields are connected, and how anything with a + or - charge reacts to them)</li>
						<li>He <b>died</b> in <b>England</b> on November 5th, <b>1879</b></li>

					<h3>Here's a time line of James Clerk Maxwell'life</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><b>1831</b>  -  Born 13 June, 14 India Street</li>
						<li><b>1846</b>  -  Maxwell’s first paper <i>“On the description of oval curves and those having a plurality of foci”</i> Proc Roy Soc Edinburgh, Vol. II</li>
						<li><b>1850</b>  -  Entered Peterhouse College, Cambridge - after one term migrated to Trinity College</li>
						<li><b>1856</b>  -  Appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy  at Marischal College, Aberdeen</li>
						<li><b>1857</b>  -  Essay on <i>“The Stability of Saturn’s Rings”</i> won the Adams Prize, University of Cambridge</li>
						<li><b>1860</b>  -  Paper <i>“Illustrations of the Dynamical Theory of Gasses”</i> where the Maxwell-Bolzman distribution for velocities in a gas are derived</li>
						<li><b>1861</b>  -  <i>“On physical lines of force”</i>, Phil. Mag. Vols. 21 & 23. Calculates that electric and magnetic effects travel at speed of light and states <i>“..we can scarcely avoid the inference that light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.”</i></li>
						<li><b>1864</b>  -  Famous oral presentation: <i>“Dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field”</i> presented to Royal Society containing ‘Maxwell’s Equations’ states <i>“.. that it seems we have strong reason to conclude that light itself (including radiant heat and other radiations if any) is an electromagnetic disturbance in the form of waves propagated ……according to the electromagnetic laws”</i></li>
						<li><b>1868</b>  -  <i>“On a method of making a direct comparison of electrostatic with electromagnetic force; with a note on the electromagnetic theory of light”</i>, Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.  (Vol. CLVIII) London,  Includes consequence of definitions of electromagnetic and electrostatic units of electric charge which makes their ratio equal to the speed of light</li>
						<li><b>1873</b>  -  Publication of his <i>“Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism“</i>, Oxford University Press</li>
						<li><b>1877</b>  -  Published book <i>‘Matter and Motion’</i></li>
						<li><b>1878</b>  -  Volta Medal, Doctor of Sciences honoris causa, University of Pavia</li>
						<li><b>1879</b>  -  Dies of stomach cancer on 5 November, Cambridge.  Buried in Parton, Castle Douglas, Galloway.</li>
